The Dragon Boat Festival, which comes on the 5th day of lunar May is one of our traditional festivals. The origin of this festival can be traced back to the Warring States Period. There was a patriotic poet named Qu Yuan. He was removed from the imperial court by a treacherous officials' slander. But, when he heard his country was conquered by enemies, he felt very sad and jumped into the river to show his loyalty. When people heard about this, they threw Zongzi into the river to feed the fish, so as to protect Quyuan's remains from the fish. They also held a Dragon Boat Race to commemorate him. Now it's still a custom to eat Zongzi and hold a Dragon Boat Race on that day.
